## Book Description

**RAG-Driven Generative AI** provides a roadmap for building effective LLM, computer vision, and generative AI systems that balance performance and costs.

This book offers a detailed exploration of RAG and how to design, manage, and control multimodal AI pipelines. By connecting outputs to traceable source documents, RAG improves output accuracy and contextual relevance, offering a dynamic approach to managing large volumes of information.

This AI book shows you how to build a RAG framework, providing practical knowledge on vector stores, chunking, indexing, and ranking. You’ll discover techniques to optimize your project’s performance and better understand your data, including:

- using adaptive RAG and human feedback to refine retrieval accuracy  
- balancing RAG with fine-tuning  
- implementing dynamic RAG to enhance real-time decision-making  
- visualizing complex data with knowledge graphs  

You’ll be exposed to a hands-on blend of frameworks like **LlamaIndex** and **Deep Lake**, vector databases such as **Pinecone** and **Chroma**, and models from **Hugging Face** and **OpenAI**.

By the end of this book, you will have acquired the skills to implement intelligent solutions, keeping you competitive in fields from production to customer service across any project.
